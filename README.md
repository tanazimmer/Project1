# Project1 Objective
RTA ridership has been declining and we would like to optimize the RTA routes.  We will use CSV files provided by the Cleveland RTA site to plot locations on heatmaps using GoogleMaps APIs.  We will analyze the dense locations of bus stops to see why there are more in some areas (hospitals, restaurants, schools) and analyze the areas that appear to have very few or no stops to ask if there would be reason to add routes/stops to those areas.
